"Weapon of Mass Distraction" explores our paradoxical relationship with smartphone technology through a series of glitch art posters. Starting with clean iPhone mockups, the digital imagery was corrupted using Audacity to manipulate image files as audio data and a text editor to alter the image data. After data corruption, Adobe Photoshop was employed to create sophisticated visual distortions across multiple chromatic variations.
The text "WEAPON of MASS DISTRACTION" works as both title and commentary on how devices made for connection now break apart our attention and get in the way of real human contact. Crowds shown as silhouettes at the bottom of each poster were AI-generated and added to show how disconnected we've become in social spaces. These figures represent the strange isolation that happens in crowded places where people are physically together but mentally lost in their digital worlds.
