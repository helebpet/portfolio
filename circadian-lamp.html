                            <h2>Concept</h2>
                            <p>Modern life has disrupted natural sleep rhythms through constant screen exposure and lack of transition rituals between day and night. The Circadian Lamp reintroduces mindfulness into sleep preparation by mimicking natural light patterns throughout the day. From 6 AM to 8 PM, it glows with gentle blue light. The lamp's main purpose activates during the two hours before bedtime, from 8 PM to 10 PM, when it slowly transitions from yellow to red before turning off completely. This signals the body that it's time for rest. Red light was chosen because it doesn't suppress melatonin production the way blue light does. After turning off, the lamp can be reactivated with a simple clap.</p>

                            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                            <p>The lamp integrates an Arduino Nano with a DS3231 real-time clock module, sound sensor for clap detection, and NeoPixel LED strip. The electronics are housed in a 3D printed base with a hollow cylinder for the LED strip, wrapped in heat-resistant Kapton tape as a protective barrier between the electronics and PLA material. The translucent shade features a twisted organic form resembling a mushroom or bell shape, designed in Blender and printed using the spiral vase setting in PrusaSlicer. The shade diffuses light softly while maintaining sculptural aesthetics.</p>

                            <h2>Design Process</h2>
                            <p>Research began by exploring existing Arduino projects including breathing trainers and sleep monitors to understand technical possibilities. Design inspiration came from WOOJ Design, a Brooklyn studio creating 3D printed lamps from recycled PLA with organic flowing forms. The project required careful integration of multiple components with smooth color transitions programmed to match circadian rhythms. The real-time clock module, sound sensor, and LED strip needed to work together seamlessly. Multiple iterations were needed to achieve proper fit between the three printed components and the right level of translucency for effective light diffusion.</p>
