                            <h2>Concept</h2>
                            <p>Beyond the Address is a magazine that explores the significance of house numbers in the Presidio Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. The magazine investigates the history of house numbers, the development of the neighborhood, and the ways in which these small typographic elements contribute to the larger identity of a community. Through this design research, the project reveals how often overlooked house numbers help define the character of a place and landscape. The project was motivated by the theme of typography in the community, focusing on how typographic elements play an understated yet vital role in shaping a neighborhood's identity.</p>

                            <h2>Design Approach</h2>
                            <p>The magazine's design reflects the modern, minimal aesthetic of Presidio Heights, where many of the house numbers are influenced by contemporary trends. The typeface Futura was chosen because it closely resembles Neutraface, a commercial typeface commonly used for house numbers in the neighborhood. This design decision ties the project to the local architectural identity while maintaining a clean, modern visual language. The project was created in Adobe InDesign, with all photographs captured in Presidio Heights. By focusing on these often overlooked elements of design, Beyond the Address pays homage to the unique house numbers that contribute to the distinctiveness of Presidio Heights.</p>
