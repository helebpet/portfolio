                        <p>Hello, my name is Petra Helebrantová. I'm a Czech multidisciplinary digital designer with a special interest in UX and UI design, based in San Francisco and Prague. I'm in my third year at the University of San Francisco, studying design with a minor in UX/UI.</p>
                        <p>I work with HTML, CSS, and P5.js for coding projects, and I'm well-versed in Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro) and Figma for UX/UI work. I've also built interactive websites using Webflow and Readymag.</p>
                        <p>Right now, I'm working as a Technology Design Tutor at USF, helping students navigate coding and design software. Last semester, I got to work with the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Hub at USF through a studio-based design class, which was an incredibly valuable experience. This past summer (2025), I completed a month-long full-time design internship at Newlogic Digital in Prague.</p>
                        <p>I'm especially drawn to design projects focused on sustainability, environmental responsibility, and improving user experiences, particularly in health, wellness, sports, and environmental spaces. My design approach is informed by my life beyond the screen or sketchbook, from running and photography to time spent in nature.</p>
                        <p>For me, great design should be sustainable, distinctive, intuitive, and carefully considered. That's what drives my work, and I'm always excited to collaborate with brands and organizations working toward meaningful change and deeper human connections.</p>
